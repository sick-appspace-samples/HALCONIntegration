## HALCONIntegration
Integration of HALCON procedures

### Description
This sample shows how HALCON procedures can be integrated into an application.
There is a trivial HALCON procedure named "Binarize" which has been developed
using HDevelop and exported as a procedure. This procedure has been added to the
resources of this application. Have a look on the function 'binarizeImage' which
encapsulates the HALCON procedure call as well as the parameters of the procedure.

### How to Run
The results can be seen in the 2D viewer on the web-page. Restarting the Sample may
be necessary to show images after loading the web-page.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API, HALCON support and
AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is required. E.g. SIM4000 with latest firmware.

### Implementation
This sample is written using HALCON 12
